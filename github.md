This is the file for my  first advanced data journalism assignment!

For this assignment, I chose the github of St. Louis Dispatch. The repository is about an interactive quiz on the website. The project used JavaScript as the program language, and css to style the webpage. The code of file quizReader.js is not that difficult to read as English language if you force yourself to read. Basically, the code gives commonds to the computer, and let the computer react to the commond under certain conditions. 

If there are questions I have to ask, I think I would raise two questions: 1. What's the differentce between the two JavaScript files? 2. Why chose JS as programming language when other language such as Python can do the same job?
